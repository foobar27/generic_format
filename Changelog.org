* Changelog
- Sequences are not variadic and flattened at construction time in the DSL. This
  change is needed for mapped sequences. <2014-12-25 Thu>
- References have been renamed to variables. We try to leave the meaning of
  /reference/ as close to the C++ meaning as possible. <2014-12-26 Fri>
- =ast::sequence= no longer has a default mapping (to =std::tuple=). This is
  required for mapping more complex types. You need to provide the mapping as
  the first item of the sequence via =dsl::seq()=, and the remaining items need
  all to have an implicit mapping. There is a wrapper mapping_tuple to create
  such a mapping yourself. <2014-12-27 Sat>
