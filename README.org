* Introduction

You define a custom binary format via an embedded domain-specific language, and 
serialize-deserialize data with this format via iostreams.

Currently the building blocks of this domain-specific language are:
- primitive formats (currently for integers),
- sequential composition of formats,
- wrapping of structs (the syntax still needs refinement).

* State

This is an early prototype, i.e.
- it almost hasn't been tested
- expect the API to change
- the code might not even compile

Things which are probably going to break: (this list is *not* exhaustive)
- primitive type, especially byte-order
- api for strings

* Requirements

The project requires =C++11=, it compiles at least with gcc 4.9.1.

For more features, and to compile the test suite and some examples, you need boost
1.56.0.
